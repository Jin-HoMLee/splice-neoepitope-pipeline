# Lab Notebook — PM

Per-role lab notebook for PM sessions. Started 2026-05-06 as part of the lab-notebook split (see `lab_notebook.md` freeze note for rationale).

Format and rules unchanged from the unified notebook — see `shared/feedback_lab_notebook.md`. New date sections at the TOP; new time sections at the TOP of the date block; entries are immutable once committed.

#### [Issue #286](https://github.com/Jin-HoMLee/splice-neoepitope-pipeline/issues/286) — lab-notebook split into per-role files (this PR)

**Why now.** 3 merge conflicts on `research/lab_notebook.md` between 2026-05-03 and 2026-05-05, all same root cause: high-traffic shared file + sync-before-branch slip. Dev escalated "sync main before branching" to role MEMORY.md Always-in-effect 2026-05-05 morning; Sci slipped on the same rule 4 hours later — discipline rule alone wasn't internalising fast enough. Sci proposed per-role files in standup [2026-05-05 15:13 UTC]; PM agreed today with one tweak (subdirectory rather than 3 top-level files for tidier `research/`).

**This PR.** Creates `research/lab_notebook/{pm,scientist,developer}.md` with minimal headers. Freezes `research/lab_notebook.md` via top-of-file banner; pre-2026-05-06 entries (and any 2026-05-06 entries already written before freeze) are immutable per `shared/feedback_lab_notebook.md` and not migrated. Forward-only change; no rewrite of historical content. This PM entry is the first one written under the new structure.

**Cerebrum memory updates ship separately.** Direct memory writes (no PR) follow this PR's merge: `shared/MEMORY.md` Always-in-effect rule pointer update, each role's morning-routine memory file pointer, `shared/feedback_lab_notebook.md` structure section, /CEREBRUM ALL broadcast, and a follow-up to Sci's [2026-05-05 15:13 UTC] proposal post on standup. Sequencing: project PR merges first so role pointers don't reference not-yet-merged paths.

**Workflow rule promoted earlier today (related).** Sci's [2026-05-06 10:16 UTC] standup post proposed extending the existing "push and merge are two separate steps" rule to also cover `git commit && git push`; promoted to shared/MEMORY.md Always-in-effect at 11:41 UTC. User caught Sci chaining commit+push for [PR #267](https://github.com/Jin-HoMLee/splice-neoepitope-pipeline/issues/267)'s docs branch this morning, and PM had also slipped on the same chain earlier in the same session ([PR #283](https://github.com/Jin-HoMLee/splice-neoepitope-pipeline/pull/283) news_log) — two slips in one morning across two roles drove the promotion.
