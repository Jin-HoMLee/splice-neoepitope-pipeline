# Lab Notebook — PM

Per-role lab notebook for PM sessions. Started 2026-05-06 as part of the lab-notebook split (see `lab_notebook.md` freeze note for rationale).

Format and rules unchanged from the unified notebook — see `shared/feedback_lab_notebook.md`. New date sections at the TOP; new time sections at the TOP of the date block; entries are immutable once committed.

#### Closure: #330 — Priority backfill for 24 pre-rule open issues (post-incident cleanup)

**Trigger.** After lunch, user asked to "quickly re-assign all priorities" — citing that the other roles couldn't decide their next-best-step without it. This closes the loop on the morning's `updateProjectV2Field` incident (see `shared/feedback_project_field_options_destructive.md`), where 25 older open issues without `**Priority rationale:**` body lines stayed MISSING after the auto-restore swept the 29 issues that did have parseable rationale lines.

**Scope reframe.** Original #330 listed 25 issues; #272 closed naturally between #330's creation (13:33 UTC) and this work (14:17 UTC), so 24 remained. Spot-check of the 29 auto-restored issues found one inconsistency — #330's own board Priority was P0 while its body said P3. User kept it at P0 with the reasoning that the missing values were actively blocking cross-role triage, and asked me to also flip #330 Status to "In progress" so the lifecycle reflects the active work. Reverted P0 back to "closes at P0 since the work was completed in one session" in the body rationale at close-time.

**Decision: P1 inheritance from P1 parents.** Initially proposed only 3 P1s (the in-progress epics #24/#86/#126). User pushed back and promoted more — accepted the candidates I flagged: #17 (STAR strategic), #204/#205/#206 (TCR-panel sub-issues of #86), #211/#212 (GTEx sub-issues of #126). Final 9 P1s. Sub-issues of #203 (#224, #225) kept at P2 because both are externally blocked (#223 AlphaGenome API access) — the inheritance rule only applies to ready/queued sub-issues. The pattern: a P1 parent + ready-or-queued sub-issue → P1 sub-issue; a P1 parent + externally-blocked sub-issue → P2 (lifts to P1 when unblocked).

**Mechanics.** Pulled 295-item board via paginated GraphQL (3 calls), filtered to 54 OPEN issues, split MISSING vs restored. Looped `updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue` for the 24 missing issues. Python script appended/replaced `**Priority rationale:** PN — <sentence>` lines on all 24 issue bodies (16 replaced existing malformed lines like "Strategic —", 8 appended fresh). Wrote each rationale by hand — no template — to capture the specific reason per issue. Final audit query: 54 OPEN, 0 MISSING.

**Distribution after backfill** (all OPEN issues): 1 P0 (#330 itself, pre-close), 12 P1, 32 P2, 9 P3. Board is now fully populated; Sci and Dev can pick next-best-step by sorting on Priority + Status.

**Closure ritual.** ACs ticked on #330, body updated with outcome table + final rationale rewritten as P0 (active-blocker), closed as completed with summary comment. Status set to Done. Per-role lab notebook entry: this one.

#### Standup file split — memory broadcasts moved to dedicated `team_memory_broadcasts.md`

**Trigger.** Early in this morning's session, user flagged that `team_standup.md` hit the Read tool ceiling (27,267 tokens vs 25k limit, 786 lines) — only 1 day after archiving 6 own Done messages. Yesterday's >3-day archive cleanup didn't dent it because the bulk wasn't *old* traffic but 13 memory broadcasts on 2026-05-05/06 (5 in a single afternoon). The >3-day archive band addresses missed-message recurrence; file-size growth from broadcast spikes is a distinct failure mode the band can't cover.

**Decision.** Split broadcasts into `shared/team_memory_broadcasts.md` rather than tightening the archive band. User picked via AskUserQuestion among 4 options (split-file [Recommended], >1-day band, >2-day band, per-role cap). Split was the structural fix because broadcasts are inherently archival/documentation (rule changes), not operational coordination — aligning content type with file purpose addresses the cause; band-tightening was a symptom-level fix and would cascade into follow-up reply lifecycles (rejected yesterday for the missed-message concern).

**Mechanics.** Python script split standup on `\n\n---\n\n` separators, filtered blocks by `[/CEREBRUM ALL]` marker, wrote both files atomically. Treated as user's explicit one-time approval to bulk-transform `team_standup.md` — the bulk-edit exclusion rule targets uncontrolled sed/find-replace, not careful structural migrations with full content preservation. **Result:** 13 broadcasts moved, 37 non-broadcast messages preserved verbatim. Active standup: 786 → 648 lines (-19%, -12.5k chars). New file: 164 lines, 13.7k chars. Verification: 0 broadcast headers leaked into standup; 15 inline `/CEREBRUM ALL` references inside non-broadcast messages preserved (immutability rule).

**Documentation updates** (direct memory edits, no PR — cerebrum repo is off-project per the no-cerebrum-git rule):

- `shared/MEMORY.md` Always-in-effect: NEW rule "Memory broadcasts have a dedicated file"; bulk-edit exclusion extended to `team_memory_broadcasts.md`.
- `shared/feedback_team_standup.md`: replaced the old `[/CEREBRUM ALL]` section with new file pointer + simpler post format (no `→ To: All [/CEREBRUM ALL]` marker — the file itself implies "to all").
- `pm/MEMORY.md` Always-in-effect: NEW rule "Cerebrum within morning routine" — separate fix earlier this session. After running `/cerebrum`, I stopped and waited for next instruction (per the skill's literal output) instead of continuing into the morning-routine agenda + TodoWrite. User asked why. Root cause: the skill's "wait for next instruction" was overriding the morning-routine pacing rule when /cerebrum is part of a routine. Promoted the precedence inline so it sticks.

**Going-forward convention.** Cross-role rule-change posts → `team_memory_broadcasts.md` (no marker needed). Coordination/asks/follow-ups → `team_standup.md`. Same immutability + sender-owned-Status rules apply to both files.

**Inaugural posts.** Posted the first new-convention broadcast to `team_memory_broadcasts.md` (top of file, no marker, full rule details). Operational pointer also posted to standup [2026-05-08 13:18 UTC] PM → All so any active Sci/Dev sessions today catch the change before their next /cerebrum.

#### [PR #293](https://github.com/Jin-HoMLee/splice-neoepitope-pipeline/pull/293) — gitignore Claude Code transient scheduler state

**Trigger.** User opened `.claude/scheduled_tasks.lock` in the IDE this evening and asked what it was. Inspection: per-session ownership lock for Claude Code's in-process cron scheduler — single-line JSON with `sessionId`, `pid`, `procStart`, `acquiredAt`. Created any time a session arms a cron in this project (today: via `/pong` for the 30-min cache-keepalive). Showed up as untracked noise in `git status`.

**Decision.** Surgical ignore for the two transient files (`.claude/scheduled_tasks.lock` + `.claude/scheduled_tasks.json` for `durable: true` jobs) rather than blanket-ignoring `.claude/` — leaves room to check in `.claude/settings.json` later if shared project-level Claude config ever becomes useful. `.claude/settings.local.json` is already covered by global `~/.config/git/ignore`.

**Mechanics.** Branch `chore/pm/gitignore-claude-scheduler-2026-05-06` off `workspace/pm`; commit, then push as separate steps (per the commit-push-merge three-step rule promoted this morning); PR opened with project board attached + Status flipped to `Ready for review` via single `updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue` GraphQL call. Branch was behind main; user updated via the GitHub UI which created a merge commit (initially read as a bot/auto-update mystery; resolved on clarification).

#### [Issue #286](https://github.com/Jin-HoMLee/splice-neoepitope-pipeline/issues/286) — lab-notebook split into per-role files (this PR)

**Why now.** 3 merge conflicts on `research/lab_notebook.md` between 2026-05-03 and 2026-05-05, all same root cause: high-traffic shared file + sync-before-branch slip. Dev escalated "sync main before branching" to role MEMORY.md Always-in-effect 2026-05-05 morning; Sci slipped on the same rule 4 hours later — discipline rule alone wasn't internalising fast enough. Sci proposed per-role files in standup [2026-05-05 15:13 UTC]; PM agreed today with one tweak (subdirectory rather than 3 top-level files for tidier `research/`).

**This PR.** Creates `research/lab_notebook/{pm,scientist,developer}.md` with minimal headers. Freezes `research/lab_notebook.md` via top-of-file banner; pre-2026-05-06 entries (and any 2026-05-06 entries already written before freeze) are immutable per `shared/feedback_lab_notebook.md` and not migrated. Forward-only change; no rewrite of historical content. This PM entry is the first one written under the new structure.

**Cerebrum memory updates ship separately.** Direct memory writes (no PR) follow this PR's merge: `shared/MEMORY.md` Always-in-effect rule pointer update, each role's morning-routine memory file pointer, `shared/feedback_lab_notebook.md` structure section, /CEREBRUM ALL broadcast, and a follow-up to Sci's [2026-05-05 15:13 UTC] proposal post on standup. Sequencing: project PR merges first so role pointers don't reference not-yet-merged paths.

**Workflow rule promoted earlier today (related).** Sci's [2026-05-06 10:16 UTC] standup post proposed extending the existing "push and merge are two separate steps" rule to also cover `git commit && git push`; promoted to shared/MEMORY.md Always-in-effect at 11:41 UTC. User caught Sci chaining commit+push for [PR #267](https://github.com/Jin-HoMLee/splice-neoepitope-pipeline/issues/267)'s docs branch this morning, and PM had also slipped on the same chain earlier in the same session ([PR #283](https://github.com/Jin-HoMLee/splice-neoepitope-pipeline/pull/283) news_log) — two slips in one morning across two roles drove the promotion.
