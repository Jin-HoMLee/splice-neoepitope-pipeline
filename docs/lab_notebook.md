**Goal:** Get TCRdock structural validation running end-to-end via Docker on the GCP GPU Spot VM.

**Done:**
- Fixed Docker build failure: the official TCRdock Dockerfile fails at `conda install openmm=7.7.0` (no longer available). Created `docker/Dockerfile.pipeline` which uses pip only and omits openmm/pdbfixer — these are only needed for optional Amber relaxation, not for `run_prediction.py`.
- Successfully built `tcrdock:latest` on GPU VM and ran TCRdock end-to-end. Pipeline completed 3/3 steps, report generated.
- Identified visual issue in report: AlphaFold outputs all residues as a single chain A, so Mol* rendered the ternary complex without chain-colour distinction. Added `relabel_pdb_chains()` to `run_tcrdock.py`, which reassigns chain IDs (A=MHC, B=peptide, C=TCR-alpha, D=TCR-beta) using the chain lengths from TCRdock's `alphafold_setup/targets.tsv`.
- Updated `setup_tcrdock_vm.sh` to build from `docker/Dockerfile.pipeline` instead of cloning TCRdock separately for the (broken) official Dockerfile.

**Next:** Re-run pipeline via `run_cloud_gpu.sh` to validate the chain-relabelling fix in the full report.
